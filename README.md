Flasky
======

This is my own progress of following the example web app in Miguel Grinberg's book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com). Python's web framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is used for this project.

The web app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](http://flaskyy.herokuapp.com/).
